# Introduction

Benchmarking Bridge Aggregators is a benchmarking framework that Benchmarks Bridge/Transaction Aggregators that was created from a Hyperledger Internship.

[https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges)

The project Benchmarks Token-Aggregators like Uniswap, Cowswap, Lifi, Socket, and XY Finance and Message-Aggregators like Hashi, Chainlink CCIP, and Hyperlane.&#x20;

The repository contains benchmarking tools, parsers that convert the routes or quotes from different token-aggregators into a standardized format. The codebase can automatically query all the protocols listed, collect the data, parse them into the benchmarking format, and then generate tables and plots to better analyze the generated data.
